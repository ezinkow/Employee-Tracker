## About This Project:

This was a homework assignment as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp to build a backend application that allows an employer to keep track of employees, their roles and departments.

This was built with Javascript, sql and Inquirer and uses node.

## Summary of Project:

This is a backend program where the programmer/user types "node employeedb.js" in the command line. The user then chooses to view, add, remove or update the database.

Each option gives users the opportunity to view employees in various ways, and add, remove or update employees, roles, departments and managers.

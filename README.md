## About This Project:

This was a homework assignment as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp to build a backend application that allows an employer to keep track of employees, their roles and departments.

This was built with Javascript, sql and Inquirer 

## Summary of Project:

This is a backend program where the programmer/user types "node employeedb.js" in the command line. The user is then given a list of possible actions:
View
Add
Remove
Update
Within each action, the user is asked what further they would like to do (examples: View all employees, add employee, remove employee, update employee, etc.).
